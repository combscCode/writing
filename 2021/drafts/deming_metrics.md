# Missing the Forest for the Trees

This article is the first of several that delve into the topics
discussed in Out of the Crisis by W. Edwards Deming. It's one
of the best books I've read on management, leadership, and just
generally being a good worker so I'd like to spend some time
writing about it.

One of the ideas that Deming emphasizes is that the most important
metrics to an organization are "unknown and unknowable". A corollary
to this point is his condemnation of "Management by use only of
visible figures, with little or no consideration of figures that
are unknown."

I love how clear minded Deming is in his writing, the book is
just dripping with purpose and direction.
