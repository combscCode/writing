# Feedback and Arrogance








## Ambien

What happens when we don't listen properly to our customers? Ambien
is a sleeping drug that's used by around 38 million Americans to increase
their amount of shut eye.

- Talk about how ambien wasn't tested on women, designers were confident
in their conclusions.
- Reports were coming in for a while about women sleepdriving and stuff
like that the next morning
- Conclusion? When mistakes are made, customers face consequences and will
likely bubble up their feedback. If you take time to listen you get an
opportunity to improve.

## Feedback Systems

But what about things that are more complex than "simply" drugs? Consider
the case of a car manufacturer who has been receiving reports that a strange
rattling noise is coming from one of their 2017 models. They've tried to
recreate the conditions that seem to be common across the reports, but the
experiments haven't been successful.

- How do you "recreate" 4 years of wear and tear properly?
- What variables aren't being reported by the customer?
- Which variables are actually relevant to the problem?
- What are the consequences of "a rattling noise"?

This feedback system is too simplistic to handle such a complex problem.
A solution might be found in one of the fundamental tools of complex system
design, the tree structure. Instead of customers reporting back raw data to
a centralized unit, they instead should go to their local mechanic. This mechanic
can both better understand the problem and report back more relevant information
to the car manufacturer.
