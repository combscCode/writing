# Software Engineering vs Computer Science
## The differences of philosophy between these two related fields

### Tags: Software Engineering, Short Form

At most universities the Computer Science department is essentially a
feeder program for putting students into software engineering positions.

I'm still definitely a noob when it comes to being a professional engineer
but I really enjoy thinking about the differences between the two fields. I'd
like to think that I'm actually better at engineering when compared to CS, so
this piece could be seen as me trying to understand why I'm better at working
when compared to schoolwork.

I've come to think of software engineering as simply CS with an extremely heavy
emphasis on results (what the user sees) and teamwork.
