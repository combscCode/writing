# Writing

I would love to be able to express myself clearly through my writing.
As with anything, the way to get better at writing is to study good
writing + practice, practice, practice.

I'm not sure where I'll post this but I have a blog located at
generallyduo.squarespace.com. I'd like to mirror this repo to
that blog, not sure if that's possible though.
